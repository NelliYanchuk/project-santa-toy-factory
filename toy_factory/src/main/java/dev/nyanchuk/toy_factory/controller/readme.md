# Controllers (Handles requests and business logic)

- The Controller layer will handle the flow of data between the Model and View layers. 
- It will process the user's input, interact with the Service and Repository layers,and then call the View layer to display the results.
- The controller will not deal with direct output (e.g., no System.out.println() here).
