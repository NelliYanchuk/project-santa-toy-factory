# Project - Santa Claus Toy Factory

## Instructions
OH! OH! OH! Santa Claus needs your help, developer! This Christmas, Santa has decided to upgrade his toy management system, leaving behind the manually created scrolls. But be careful! The system will behave differently depending on whether Santa or one of his elves is using it, and data storage will vary depending on whether the toy is for a good child or a naughty child.

Your task is to create a console application that allows Santa's elves to register new toys, list the inventory, and delete toys.

If Santa uses the application, he should be able to view the list of toys for good children or the list of toys for naughty children. Additionally, Santa should have the option to save the entire toy list in .csv format.

## Objective
To gradually approach the classic Spring Boot architecture. Apply the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern to structure the application. Understand and implement the repository pattern and dependency inversion.

## User Stories
