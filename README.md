# Project - Santa Claus Toy Factory

## Description
OH! OH! OH! Santa Claus needs your help, developer!!! For this Christmas, Santa has decided to update his toy management system and leave behind the creation of long scrolls by hand. But WATCH OUT! The system will behave differently depending on whether it's used by Santa or one of his elves, and the data storage system will be different depending on whether the toy is for good children or bad children.

You have been tasked with creating a console application that will allow Santaâ€™s elves to register toys created, list the inventory, and delete toys.

If the application is used by Santa, he will be able to view the list of toys for good children or the list of toys for bad children. He will also have the ability to save the complete list of all toys in .csv format.

Gradually approach the classic architecture of Spring Boot. Apply the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern to structure the application. Understand and apply the repository pattern and dependency inversion.

### User Stories
